To automatically update data daily:

1. **Add GitHub Actions Workflow**:
```yaml
name: Update Data
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 8 * * *'  # Run daily at 8 AM UTC
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Trigger app refresh
        run: echo "Data updated" > last_update.txt
      - name: Commit changes
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "action@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Action"
          git add .
          git commit -m "Daily data update" || exit 0
          git push
```

2. **Connect Real APIs**:
   - Replace simulated data with live MLB Stats API
   - Add betting odds from The Odds API
   - Include injury reports and weather data
